# BlueBuild Modules

This repository contains additional modules and if needed, temporary fixes for [upstream modules](https://github.com/blue-build/modules/), used by my custom [Fedora Atomic Desktop](https://fedoraproject.org/atomic-desktops/) images built with [BlueBuild](https://blue-build.org/).

Used in images:

* [Fedora Base](https://github.com/lorduskordus/fedora-base)
* [Fedora LK](https://github.com/lorduskordus/fedora-lk)
